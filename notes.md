# Notes During Test

## Running Thoughts
That is a lot of stuff I need to accomplish. I actually haven't set up this computer for terraform or anything (Using non-work computer), so lets do that first.

Ok that is done, Windows machines are weird to install Terraform and Python.

They use Flask/Terraform/Ansible/Nomad. Haven't used a lot of Nomad so lets use ElasticBeanstalk as I know that a little better. Haven't had to write my own microservice in a while.

Nice tutorial, lets use this as jumping off point: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html
